Sudoku-Solver
=============

A program developed by me for my advanced higher computing project. This program, when run, will take a user-inputted sudoku puzzle and output the solution, using a basic moves list in order to solve it. Program has been coded in C# .NET 4.5 although source code can be compiled under earlier versions of .NET with no issues.
